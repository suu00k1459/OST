## Local Preprocessing Setup

To run the preprocessing script on your local machine, you must place your **`kaggle.json`** credential file in the correct directory.

**Required location:**

```plaintext
C:\Users\yourusername\.kaggle\

If you are running the preprocessing through Docker Compose (the recommended approach), place the token instead in the repository `kaggle/` directory:

```plaintext
./kaggle/kaggle.json
```
